// Not much else we can assign to these variables!
let u: undefined = undefined;
let n: null = null;

// By default null and undefined are subtypes of all other types.

// However, when using the --strictNullChecks flag, null and undefined are only assignable to any and their respective types (the one exception being that undefined is also assignable to void).
