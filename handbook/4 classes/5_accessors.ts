// A couple of things to note about accessors:

// First, accessors require you to set the compiler to output ECMAScript 5 or higher. Downleveling to ECMAScript 3 is not supported.
// Second, accessors with a get and no set are automatically inferred to be readonly. This is helpful when generating a .d.ts file from your code, because users of your property can see that they canâ€™t change it.
